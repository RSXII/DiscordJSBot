# BroBot - A DiscordJS bot.

## What is it?
BroBot is a DiscordJS bot currently in development in my spare time.
It is being developed for streamer ChaseTheBro with future functionality being added by myself in order to serve other streamers as well.

## What are my planned features?
Currently there are a few features: Help, quick links to social media, a basic points system, a system to announce streams.
There are many things planned still and they will be added in order of importance and or how long they will take to impliment.

I plan on adding integration with google's youtube api and twitch api to automatically pull new videos and announce livestreams sometime in the future.

More planned features to come.

## Requirements

NodeJS is required to run the bot.
